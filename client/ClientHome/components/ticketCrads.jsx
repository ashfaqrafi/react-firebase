        description: 'I purchased a Samsung Smart TV in November 2016. A few months after purchasing pixels started to go out - slowly growing into a black line down the side. Lived with it a couple of months until I found my warranty info. After speaking with many, many people who offer the exact same advice they said to send it in because it was still under warranty. Now I am being told that the warranty is is no longer valid because the LCD is cracked. ',

        description: 'Typically the battery on a new phone is only charged a little less than half allowing the owner to conduct basic set up of the phone when purchased. Normally they have multiple settings on that do drain the battery prior to initial setup and you would be required to turn them off. The battery should never typically drain drastically fast there may be an issue with a connection on your charger... if a wireless charger being used proper alignment of the phone to charger is required.

A fake iPhone would not properly and successfully install an iOS update from Apple's servers via iTunes, and iTunes would most likely reject the phone. If you encounter any errors, this doesn't necessarily mean your iPhone is fake. An update may fail for a variety of reasons. But if it completes successfully, it is highly improbable to be fake.",
